	# They maintained their independence until the High Kingdom fell.
	# Many major Salt Dornish houses such as the Martell's started as their subject in the initial invasion.
	# The houses seat was negotiated in a mercenary contract to explain the lack of a horder of other adventurers. Currently too far from the beginning of the invasion.
	# Also fits in with idea of Dorne being separate from the rest of Westeros. Even the Andal settlers took a different route.
