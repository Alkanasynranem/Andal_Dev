Deleting Valyrian character history made 7887.1.1 work. 7087.1.1 still had issues.
Actually it was Riverlander history. Wonder why.
Launched in 7860.1.1 with no issues.
7840 worked, 7830 crashed.
7832 worked, 7831 crashed.
7832 is when a couple counties in free cities are initialized. May be cause of issue.

Something in riverlands ancestors between House Smallwood and House Sylvas is causing the issue.
Crashed from Sylvas to Qoherys. So issue is between Smallwood and Qoherys.
Smallwood/Whistler. Worked. So issue is inbetween them.
Whistelr/Heddle. Worked, issue is in between them.
Whistler/Deddings. Crashed so issue in between Deddings/Heddle.
Ryger/Heddle.
